# CS50P
All that I did in CS50P.

Why does this exist?

To look back at what I did in CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python.

I used to look at other peoples solutions after doing the problem sets to get a different perspective/approach to a problem. Solutions may be suboptimal but they might help someone.
